I am a passionate Tech activist with over [**17 years of software engineering experience**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agnescrepet/).

Since 2015, my work time has been split between my own IT company, [Ninja Squad](http://ninja-squad.com/), and a position in a French engineering School, [Mines Saint-Etienne](http://www.mines-stetienne.fr). Beside that, I’m actively involved in [**non-profit collectives and Tech communities**](/activism/).

I'm the head of Learning innovation Department at the French engineering School [Mines Saint-Etienne](http://www.mines-stetienne.fr). I lead a team of 6 people who build ingenious pedagogical tools and encourage innovation and change in the learning environment.

The IT company I co-founded in France, [Ninja Squad](http://ninja-squad.com/), is well-known for its core values. We apply a **cooperative management**, we **support open source**, we do sometimes [voluntary development](https://blog.ninja-squad.com/2018/05/10/globe42/) (the last one is for a migrant health center) and [our technical books about Angular](https://books.ninja-squad.com/angular) are sold under a “Pay what you want” mode, supporting non-profit organizations like [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/).

I like knowledge sharing too: beside [my courses on Computer Sciences and Agile methodologies](/teaching),I **talk** about technical or non-technical topics at several IT events (Devoxx France, JFokus, several Meetups, …).
