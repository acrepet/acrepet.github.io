**Who am I ?**

I am a passionate tech activist with over 17 years of software engineering experience (see my LinkedIn profile for a more corporate [resume](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agnescrepet/)).

I’m actively involved in French [**non-profit collectives and Tech communities**](/activism/).

In 2012, I co-founded [Ninja Squad](http://ninja-squad.com/), which is well-known in France for its core values : support open source, cooperative management, [voluntary development](https://blog.ninja-squad.com/2018/05/10/globe42/) (the last one is for a migrant health center), [our technical books about Angular](https://books.ninja-squad.com/angular) are sold under a “Pay what you want” mode supporting non-profit organizations like [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/).

In September 2018, I moved with my family abroad (such an important and large chunk of my life!). I joined [Fairphone](https://www.fairphone.com/en/), in Amsterdam, as the head of IT. Fairphone is a social enterprise driving change in the electronics industry from the inside out. Its business model is based on social values and securing continuity and centers around producing and marketing smartphones in a way that puts social and environmental values first.

I like knowledge sharing too: beside [my courses on Computer Sciences and Agile methodologies](/teaching), I talk about technical or non-technical topics at several IT events (Devoxx France, JFokus, several Meetups, …).
