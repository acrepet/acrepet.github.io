I am a passionate technologist with over **17 years of software engineering experience**. I want to put my skills to help Tech projects to have a **true and significative positive impact on the world**. Since 2015, my work time is spread between my own IT company, [Ninja Squad](http://ninja-squad.com/), and a position in a French engineering School, [Mines Saint-Etienne](http://www.mines-stetienne.fr), where I teach Computer Sciences or Agile, and I lead a team of 6 people who build ingenious pedagogical tools and encourage innovation and change in learning environment. [Ninja Squad](http://ninja-squad.com/) is famous in France for its core values. We have a cooperative management, we support open source, we often do [voluntary development](https://blog.ninja-squad.com/2018/05/10/globe42/) (the last one is for a migrant health center) and [our technical books about Angular](https://books.ninja-squad.com/angular) are sold under a “Pay what you want” mode, supporting non-profit organizations like [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/).

In my opinion, doing software is a job requiring self questioning and **having ethics**. I favor
career choices that make IT a great tool to help people and serve **projects with societal and environmental impacts**, and I'm strongly involved too in non-profit Tech communities : you could find out more about my [tech activism](/activism/). I like knowledge sharing too: beside the courses on Computer Sciences and Agile methodologies I give in the Engineering School where I work, I do some workshops to introduce the basics of
coding for kids (currently I'm setting up a new side project : [NKOTC](http://new-kids-on-the-code.io) (New Kids On The Code)), and I talk about technical or non-technical topics at several IT events (Devoxx France, JFokus, several Meetups, ...).
