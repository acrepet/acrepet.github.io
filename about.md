I am a passionate technologist with over 15 years of software engineering experience. I'm the co-founder of [Ninja Squad](http://ninja-squad.com/). I like knowledge sharing: I teach and I talk at several events. I encourage innovation and change in learning environment, specially at [Mines Saint-Etienne](http://mines-stetienne.fr), a French engineering School.

I lead IT events or organizations, promoting diversity in IT, as co-leader of  [Duchess France](http://duchess-france.org) and co-founder of the [MiXiT Conference](https://mixitconf.org).
