I am a passionate technologist with over **17 years of software engineering experience** (see my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agnescrepet/)). Since 2015, my work time has been split between my own IT company, [Ninja Squad](http://ninja-squad.com/), and a position in a French engineering School, [Mines Saint-Etienne](http://www.mines-stetienne.fr), where I **lead a team of 6 people who build ingenious pedagogical tools** and encourage innovation and change in the learning environment.

I want to put my skills to use in Tech projects which **have a true and significative positive impact on the world**. I favor career choices that **make IT a great tool to help people and serve projects with societal and environmental impacts**. I feel that working in Software means you're constantly thinking critically with an **ethical stance**.

The IT company I co-founded in France, [Ninja Squad](http://ninja-squad.com/), is well-known for its core values. We apply a **cooperative management**, we **support open source**, we do sometimes [voluntary development](https://blog.ninja-squad.com/2018/05/10/globe42/) (the last one is for a migrant health center) and [our technical books about Angular](https://books.ninja-squad.com/angular) are sold under a “Pay what you want” mode, supporting non-profit organizations like [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/).

I’m [**actively involved in non-profit Tech communities**](/activism/). I'm on the board of [Duchess France](http://www.duchess-france.org/), a collective which **encourage diversity in Tech** and women to be more visible. I co-founded the [MiXiT conference](https://mixitconf.org), a yearly 2-days IT event, with almost 700 attendees and speakers, offering a wide variety of technologies  which has highlighted  **Tech Activism initiatives** since its beginning, allowing the participants to become aware of their social responsibility. I like knowledge sharing too: beside the courses on Computer Sciences and Agile methodologies I give in the Engineering School where I work, I do some workshops to introduce the basics of coding for kids (currently I'm setting up a new side project : [NKOTC](http://new-kids-on-the-code.io) (New Kids On The Code)), and I **talk about technical or non-technical topics at several IT events** (Devoxx France, JFokus, several Meetups, …).
