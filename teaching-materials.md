I teach at [Mines Saint-Etienne](http://mines-stetienne.fr), a French Engineering School. Since September 2015, beside my courses in Computer Science (Git, <a href="{{ "gradle-lab.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Gradle</a>, <a href="{{ "web-lab.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Web programming</a>, <a href="{{ "spring-boot-lab.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Spring Boot</a>, Software Software architectures) and Agile (Scrum, Kanban, Lean Startup), I lead the Department of Learning Innovation, encouraging changes in learning environment.
I bring people (students and teachers) together to explore agile learning practices, digital tools and active pedagogical methodologies (with practices like problem-based learning, serious games).

Before this permanent position, I always taught for various Engineering Schools and Universities as part-time job since the end of my studies, because I really enjoy teaching!
