I've been teaching Computer Sciences for the last 17 years, not as a full-time job, but occasionally just because I really like it &hearts; !

Among of my last course topics, I teach Git, <a href="{{ "gradle-lab.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Gradle</a> (EN), <a href="{{ "web-lab.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Web programming</a> (EN), <a href="{{ "spring-boot-lab.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Spring Boot</a> (EN), [Enterprise Software Architecture](/teaching/Architectures_Modernes_SI.pdf) (FR), Agile methodologies like Scrum, Kanban or [Lean Startup](/teaching/LeanStartupMines220118.pdf) (FR).

From 2015 to 2018, I was the head of the Department of Learning Innovation at [Mines Saint-Etienne](http://mines-stetienne.fr), a French Engineering School. I led a team of 6 people who build ingenious pedagogical tools and encourage innovation and change in the learning environment.
I brought people (students and teachers) together to explore agile learning practices and active pedagogical methodologies (with practices like problem-based learning, serious games).
See [the slides of my last talk about agile pedagogy](/teaching/PedagogiesAgiles070218.pdf) (FR)
