I like to learn, [teach](/teaching), [write](/posts), [code](https://github.com/acrepet) and make stuff up<!--, [talk](/talks)-->. I'm moving to the Netherlands this summer, I'm seeking opportunities in Amsterdam \o/

I want to put my skills to use in Tech projects which have a true and **significative positive impact on the world**. I favor career choices that make IT a great tool to help people and serve projects with **societal and environmental impacts**. I feel that working in Software means you're constantly thinking critically with an **ethical stance**.
