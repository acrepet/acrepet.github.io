I am convinced that technology doesnâ€™t always operate in our best interests and I'm trying to do doing something about it. I co-founded [MiXiT](https://mixitconf.org), a yearly IT event in France, with almost 700 attendees and speakers, which has been highlighting Tech Activism initiatives since 2011. I co-run [Duchess France ](http://www.duchess-france.org/) which promotes women in IT. I do some free workshops to introduce the basics of coding for kids. I launched in 2003 [Le Numero Zero](https://lenumerozero.lautre.net/) a French alternative web media, in the spirit of Indymedia, an open publishing worldwide network of journalist collectives that report on political and social issues. I'm involved in [Avataria](http://www.avataria.org/) a French collective which has been organizing for the last twenty years cultural events and Tech workshops for the protection of personal data and privacy and the promotion of free softwares.

[MiXiT](https://mixitconf.org) conference is a beautiful story began in 2010. We co-founded it with some friends, specially with [Cedric Exbrayat](https://hypedrivendev.io/) with who I co-led the [Lyon Java User Group](http://www.lyonjug.org/) at this moment. We always wanted this conference to be more than an IT conference gathering our whole values: we want it to be more accessible (notably by its price), to open it towards broader subjects than our daily tech routines, with speakers from outside of the IT field (our aliens). Our commitment is to promote diversity in Tech and MiXiT has been highlighting Tech Activism initiatives since its beginning. Allowing our participants to become aware of their social responsibility is one of our objectives, inviting them to question the limits of their own ethics.

I'm on the board of [Duchess France ](http://www.duchess-france.org/) too. This association inspires and encourages women to speak at conferences or technical events, to be more visible. I do [several interviews](http://www.duchess-france.org/author/acrepet/) focused on both technical and non-technical topics, for example my last ones (in French):
- about [breast-feeding in IT](http://www.duchess-france.org/mafia-lactee-travail/)
- my interview of [Charlotte Duruisseau](http://www.duchess-france.org/interview-de-charlotte-passionnee-transports-intelligents/), a customer-centric data scientist, passionate about intelligent transport systems.
- my interview of [Claire Fougerouse](http://www.duchess-france.org/jai-teste-qbits-spintronique-japon/#more-9281) about qubits and spintronics
