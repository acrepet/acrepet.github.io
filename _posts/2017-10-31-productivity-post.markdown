[Alex Duloz](https://twitter.com/alexduloz) sent me an email last August, he asked me if I could be interested in writing an article about productivity.

Alex used to run [The Pastry Box Project](https://the-pastry-box-project.net). The Pastry Box is a collective blog which has published one new post every day for four years (from 2012 to 2015).

He had started a new publishing venture which started on January the 1st 2017 : aA collective blog about productivity called [The Human In The Machine](https://thehumaninthemachine.com/).

His objective for 2017: 365 days and 365 posts from 365 contributors.

He had already published people like [Eric Meyer](https://twitter.com/meyerweb), [Lena Reinhard](https://twitter.com/lrnrd), [Angelina Fabbro](https://twitter.com/hopefulcyborg) and [Harry Roberts](https://twitter.com/csswizardry) amongst others.

I've accepted his proposal. Here is [my post](https://superyesmore.com/d7ead9497abf1b458f5be14bd33b6c11) about productivity!
