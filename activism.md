I co-run [Duchess France ](http://www.duchess-france.org/) since 2010. This association promotes women developers and women in IT, to inspire and encourage them to speak at conferences or technical events, to be more visible. I do [several interviews](http://www.duchess-france.org/author/acrepet/) focused on both technical and non-technical topics, for example my last ones (in French):

- about [breast-feeding in IT](http://www.duchess-france.org/mafia-lactee-travail/) in IT

- my interview of [Charlotte Duruisseau](http://www.duchess-france.org/interview-de-charlotte-passionnee-transports-intelligents/), a customer-centric data scientist, passionate about intelligent transport systems.

- my interview of [Claire Fougerouse](http://www.duchess-france.org/jai-teste-qbits-spintronique-japon/#more-9281) about qubits and spintronics
