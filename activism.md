I co-run [Duchess France ](http://www.duchess-france.org/) since 2010. This association promotes women developers and women in IT, to inspire and encourage them to speak at conferences or technical events, to be more visible. I do [several interviews](http://www.duchess-france.org/author/acrepet/) focused on both technical and non-technical topics, for example my last ones (in French):

- about [breast-feeding in IT](http://www.duchess-france.org/mafia-lactee-travail/) in IT

- my interview of [Charlotte Duruisseau](http://www.duchess-france.org/interview-de-charlotte-passionnee-transports-intelligents/), a customer-centric data scientist, passionate about intelligent transport systems.

- my interview of [Claire Fougerouse](http://www.duchess-france.org/jai-teste-qbits-spintronique-japon/#more-9281) about qubits and spintronics

I co-founded [MiXiT](https://mixitconf.org) conference, which is a beautiful story began in 2011, 2 days, each year, for discovering new things and meeting nice people. Our commitment is to offer a variety of topics, technologies and also attendees diversity. Xe want this conference to be more than an IT conference gathering our whole ecosystem: we want it to be accessible (notably by its price), to open it towards broader subjects than our daily routines, with speakers from outside of the field (our aliens).
