I am convinced that technology doesnâ€™t always operate in our best interests and I'm trying to do doing something about it.

I co-founded [MiXiT](https://mixitconf.org) conference which is a a beautiful story began in 2010. MiXiT is a yearly 2-days IT event in Lyon (France), with almost 700 attendees and speakers! We co-founded it with some friends, specially with [Cedric Exbrayat](https://hypedrivendev.io/) with who I co-led the [Lyon Java User Group](http://www.lyonjug.org/) at this moment. We always wanted this conference to be more than an IT conference gathering our whole values: we want it to be more accessible (notably by its price), to open it towards broader subjects than our daily tech routines, with speakers from outside of the IT field (our aliens). Our commitment is to promote diversity in Tech and MiXiT has been highlighting Tech Activism initiatives since its beginning. Allowing our participants to become aware of their social responsibility is one of our objectives, inviting them to question the limits of their own ethics.

I co-run [Duchess France ](http://www.duchess-france.org/) too. This association promotes women developers and women in IT, to inspire and encourage them to speak at conferences or technical events, to be more visible.


I do [several interviews](http://www.duchess-france.org/author/acrepet/) focused on both technical and non-technical topics, for example my last ones (in French):
- about [breast-feeding in IT](http://www.duchess-france.org/mafia-lactee-travail/) in IT
- my interview of [Charlotte Duruisseau](http://www.duchess-france.org/interview-de-charlotte-passionnee-transports-intelligents/), a customer-centric data scientist, passionate about intelligent transport systems.
- my interview of [Claire Fougerouse](http://www.duchess-france.org/jai-teste-qbits-spintronique-japon/#more-9281) about qubits and spintronics
