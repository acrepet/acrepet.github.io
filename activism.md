I co-run [Duchess France ](http://www.duchess-france.org/) and I co-founded and co-run [MiXiT](https://mixitconf.org) conference since 2010.

First of all : few words about [Duchess France ](http://www.duchess-france.org/)! This association promotes women developers and women in IT, to inspire and encourage them to speak at conferences or technical events, to be more visible. I do [several interviews](http://www.duchess-france.org/author/acrepet/) focused on both technical and non-technical topics, for example my last ones (in French):
- about [breast-feeding in IT](http://www.duchess-france.org/mafia-lactee-travail/) in IT
- my interview of [Charlotte Duruisseau](http://www.duchess-france.org/interview-de-charlotte-passionnee-transports-intelligents/), a customer-centric data scientist, passionate about intelligent transport systems.
- my interview of [Claire Fougerouse](http://www.duchess-france.org/jai-teste-qbits-spintronique-japon/#more-9281) about qubits and spintronics

My second voluntary involvement in Tech communities is [MiXiT](https://mixitconf.org) which is a a beautiful story began in 2010. MiXiT is a yearly 2-days event, with almost 700 attendees and speakers, for discovering new things and meeting nice people! We co-founded this event with some friends, specially with [Cedric Exbrayat](https://hypedrivendev.io/) with who I co-led the [Lyon Java User Group](http://www.lyonjug.org/) at this moment.
We always wanted this conference to be more than an IT conference gathering our whole values: we want it to be accessible (notably by its price), to open it towards broader subjects than our daily tech routines, with speakers from outside of the IT field (our aliens). Our commitment is to offer a variety of technologies, a variety of subjects, and also attendees diversity.
